# Session Context Summary — North Vista Marketing (NVM) / Krista Environment

**Date:** 2026-07-21
**Author:** Claude (Cowork mode)
**Scope:** North Vista Marketing (NVM) workspace only.
**Purpose:** Shared context/handoff document. Anyone on the team can paste or attach this into their own Claude Desktop (or any LLM) session so they don't start from a clean slate — it captures the NVM environment, discovered structures, IDs, governance findings, and open items from this working session.

**How to use:** Attach this file (or paste its contents) at the start of a new session with the North Vista Krista MCP server connected. The assistant will then know the invoker IDs, doc set contents, tool governance quirks, and project classifications without re-discovery.

---

## 1. Environment & Connections

Working inside **Claude Cowork mode**, connected to the **North Vista Krista MCP server** (a.k.a. NVM / North Vista Marketing) — an SEO/marketing agency workspace with tooling for SEMrush, Google Ads, GoHighLevel, GitHub, Outlook, doc sets, and skills.

The North Vista server exposes both direct MCP tools (callable like normal tools) and a generic execution path (`krista_execute_tool`) for invoker-hosted requests. **Key behavioral difference discovered:** direct MCP tools executed fine, but `krista_execute_tool` enforces Krista role-based governance (see §5).

---

## 2. Doc Sets (Krista Knowledge Bases)

`document_sets_available` on North Vista returns three doc sets:

1. **nv-boost-krista-ai** — not explored this session.
2. **nv-boost-pivot-fitness** — explored (see below).
3. **ws_0bfb7774-940c-4f7d-90db-2675ba74cbb4** — explored (see below).

**Important retrieval caveat:** the `answer_question` tool answers by **relevance / RAG retrieval**, not a true file index. It returns a `Documents referenced` array per query. To enumerate a doc set, run several *varied* queries (different dates, topics, angles) until the referenced-document set **converges** (stops surfacing new filenames). That convergence method is how the inventories below were built.

### 2a. ws_0bfb7774-940c-4f7d-90db-2675ba74cbb4
Contains **3 meeting transcripts**, all "Project Sync – Krista / NVM" calls (late June 2026):

- `meeting_2026-06-23-1900_Project-Sync-Krista-NVM_IN2P4.txt`
- `meeting_2026-06-25-1900_Project-Sync-Krista-NVM_7UUWR.txt`
- `meeting_2026-06-30-1900_Project-Sync-Krista-NVM_RCIMN.txt`

(1900 = 7:00 PM. Contents not yet summarized.)

### 2b. nv-boost-pivot-fitness
Contains **5 files**:

- `NV-2026-21-Pivot-Fitness-MSA.pdf` — Marketing Services Agreement between **North Vista Marketing LLC** and **Pivot Fitness**. Growth partnership, SEO/content strategy, three-phase plan (Discover → Build → Grow), standard legal clauses.
- `pivot-fitness-landing-page.txt` — Landing page copy for Pivot Fitness (Kaysville, Utah).
- `pivot-fitness-blog-strength-training.txt` — Blog/guide on beginner strength training (benefits, safety for older adults/youth; promotes a 2-week trial for $1).
- `test-blog-strength-training-kaysville.txt` — Test/draft version of the strength-training blog. **(test artifact)**
- `Filer-Skill-Test-2026-07-16.txt` — Internal filing-pipeline test doc; marker phrase "THE CANARY LIFTS AT DAWN." **(test artifact)**

Substantive client material = MSA + landing page + strength-training blog. Two files are leftover test artifacts.

## 3. Data-Handling Note (NVM/Krista)

Two vendor boundaries exist when working with NVM client data through this setup:

- **Anthropic** — under Commercial terms (Team/Enterprise/API), customer data is not used for training by default; the customer is Controller and Anthropic is Processor. Confirm the account is under Commercial/Enterprise terms when client data is involved. Details in the Anthropic Trust Center (trust.anthropic.com).
- **Krista** — the MCP server, doc sets, and connector data (SEMrush, GoHighLevel, Outlook, GitHub) are governed by Krista's own terms and security posture, separate from Anthropic's.

### SEMRush Sandbox invoker (INV_353a856a-867b-4f1f-a004-6ee3ad09c339)
13 tools — 11 APPROVED/executable, 2 PENDING_REVIEW (not executable until admin approval):

| Tool | Display | Type | Governance | Key params |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `get_projects` | Get Projects | QUERY | APPROVED | none |
| `create_project` | Create Project | CHANGE | **PENDING** | Domain URL, Project Name |
| `url_organic_research` | URL Organic Research | QUERY | APPROVED | URL, Database?, Limit? |
| `export_audit_pdf` | Export Audit PDF | QUERY | APPROVED | Project ID, Snapshot ID |
| `deliver_audit_report` | Deliver Audit Report | CHANGE | APPROVED | Project ID, Recipient Email?, Client Name (**sends email**) |
| `keyword_overview_research` | Keyword Overview Research | QUERY | APPROVED | Phrase, Database? |
| `get_audit_status` | Get Audit Status | QUERY | APPROVED | Project ID |
| `domain_organic_research` | Domain Organic Research | QUERY | APPROVED* | Domain, Database?, Limit? |
| `get_audit_report` | Get Audit Report | QUERY | APPROVED | Project ID, Snapshot ID |
| `run_site_audit` | Run Site Audit | CHANGE | APPROVED | Client URL, Client Name, Crawl Limit? |
| `keyword_research` | Keyword Research | QUERY | APPROVED | Phrase, Database?, Limit? |
| `get_project` | Get Project | QUERY | **PENDING** | Project ID |
| `audit_completed` | Audit Completed (sync end-to-end) | QUERY | APPROVED | Client URL, Client Name, Crawl Limit?, Recipient Email? |

`domain_organic_research` catalog_request_id = `localDomainRequest_ke339501-0000-0000-0000-000000000003`.

\* Marked APPROVED in the invoker, but blocked at execution — see §5.

**Suggested end-to-end audit path:** `get_projects` → `run_site_audit` → `get_audit_status` (poll to FINISHED) → `get_audit_report` → `export_audit_pdf` (→ `deliver_audit_report` to email).

## 5. SEMrush Test Run (results)

Ran the **research suite** against a neutral public target (**nike.com** / phrase "running shoes"). **4 of 5 passed:**

| Request | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `get_projects` | ✅ | 38 active projects returned |
| `keyword_overview_research` | ✅ | "running shoes" → 201K volume, $0.97 CPC, comp 1.0, Commercial intent |
| `keyword_research` | ✅ | 10 related keywords (brooks, best running shoes, etc.) |
| `url_organic_research` | ✅ | nike.com → 10 ranking keywords |
| `domain_organic_research` | ❌ | `MCP error -32602: You do not have permission to execute this tool. Required roles: [Marketing Team]` |

**Key finding (governance):** the 4 passing tools are exposed as **direct MCP tools** and ran fine. `domain_organic_research` is **not** a direct tool, so it had to route through `krista_execute_tool`, which enforces Krista **role-based governance** and blocked it (connection lacks the **Marketing Team** role). This is a permissions/role gap, not a broken request. Other execute-path-only tools (e.g., the pending `create_project` / `get_project`) will likely hit the same wall.

## 7. Open Items / Recommendations

1. **Role gap:** grant the connection the **Marketing Team** role to unblock `domain_organic_research` and other `krista_execute_tool`-routed requests.
2. **Pending approvals:** approve `create_project` and `get_project` in Krista Studio → MCP Server → Tool Governance if project creation/lookup is needed.
3. **Cleanup:** consider deleting the 20 test projects (IDs in §6).
4. **Pivot Fitness:** no SEMrush project yet — create one to test the audit pipeline against a real client.
5. **Doc set hygiene:** two test files sit in `nv-boost-pivot-fitness` (see §2b).

**GitHub note:** repository names are intentionally not recorded here — repos change over time. Discover them at session time: the GitHub tools (`get_repository`, `get_repository_tree`, `create_or_update_file`, etc.) take owner/repository params with no defaults configured, so list the org's current repos (GitHub org page or API) and confirm access with `get_repository` before reading/writing.
